# Justin 1

## Challenge:

I haven't talked to my mans Justin Zimmerman in a few weeks. I'm afraid he's gone missing. He never gave me any of his socials, but I have this image of him. Can you find out what he has been doing?

## Solution:

We know his full name and we know what he looks like:

<img src="justin.PNG" alt="This person does not exist." width="200">

Reverse image searching the headshot won’t do anything for us, the picture was probably generated for this challenge.

If we search Facebook for “Justin Zimmerman”, one result stands out. They’re listed as “Account Manager at Альфа-Банк” (Alfa-Bank), their alma mater is the University of Maryland, and their picture seems to be a match.

Their profile tells us they’re also on LinkedIn as “Justin Z” and their nickname is “Zimmy Boi”. We also get what appears to be a piece of our flag set as their mother’s name: `y0u_f1nd_`.

If we go to LinkedIn and search “Justin Z account manager”, we get a hit. They have the CompTIA CTF+ certification (which sadly does not exist), with a credential ID of another part of our flag: `h!s_@cc0unts?}`.

Nothing shows up on Instagram for “Zimmy Boi” (other than a lot of Invader Zim fan art). Same for the name Justin Zimmerman. But we do get a hit on Twitter, finding his profile and another piece of our flag in a Tweet: `411_0f_`.

We can rearrange our findings so far and see `y0u_f1nd_411_0f_h!s_@cc0unts?`.

Based on the format, we can guess the first and final portion of the flag: `UMDCTF-{d1d_y0u_f1nd_411_0f_h!s_@cc0unts?}`.
