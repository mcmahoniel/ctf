# Art Class

## Challenge:

I was drawing in art class when I glanced over at my classmates drawings. I snapped a picture because I wanted to look up what it meant. Can you figure out what this drawing is?

## Solution:

We're given a picture with a series of flags:

<img src="msg.png" alt="Diver Down" width="600">

They look nautical. Sure enough, they're [maritime signal flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags).

Translating our image, we get our flag: `UMDCTF-{F1AG_0F_7LA9S}`
