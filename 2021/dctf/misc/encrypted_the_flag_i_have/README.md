## Challenge:

Decrypted flag is not in exact format.

## Solution:

The title of the challenge is a reference to Yoda, and the text is clearly written in the [Aurebesh alphabet](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aurebesh).

If we plug in every character into [an online tool](https://www.dcode.fr/aurebesh-alphabet), we get our flag: `DCTF{MASTERCODEBREAKER}`.
